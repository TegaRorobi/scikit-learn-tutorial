# Scikit-learn Tutorial 

## Introduction 
[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification,
regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting and k-means and is 
designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

## Repository description 
This repository contains 3 separate notebooks, each covering different aspects of data preprocessing for machine learning
using scikit-learn, namely:
- Feature encoding
- Feature scaling
- Missing values imputation
